# ML-Income-Classifier-Using-UCI-Adult-Data-Set.

This project uses the UCI Adult dataset to predict whether an individualâ€™s income exceeds $50,000. It involves data preprocessing (e.g., binary indicators, standardization), exploratory analysis, and applying machine learning models like Lasso, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest. The models are evaluated using classification accuracy and confusion matrices to identify the best performer. This repository includes the R code and documentation for the analysis.
